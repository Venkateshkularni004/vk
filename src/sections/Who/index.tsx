          <About highlighted title="Backend" icon={imgBackend} className={style.about}>
            <p>While frontend development excites me, I have a strong inclination towards backend development, as it allows me to delve into the core functionality of an application, shaping its logic and powering its capabilities. With expertise in technologies like Node.js and PostgreSQL, I specialize in developing performant and secure backend solutions that meet modern application needs.</p>
